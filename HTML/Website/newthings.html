    <p class="p1">GitHub (/ˈɡɪthʌb/ ⓘ) is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and
        share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control,
        bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every
        project.[9] Headquartered in California, GitHub, Inc. has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.[10] </p>

        <p class="p1">It is commonly used to host open source software development projects.[11] As of January 2023, GitHub reported
        having over 100 million developers[12] and more than 420 million repositories,[13] including at least 28 million
        public repositories.[14] It is the world's largest source code host as of June 2023. Over five billion developer
        contributions were made to more than 500 million open source projects in 2024.[15]

        <h1 id="heading1">About</h1>
        Founding
        The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.[16][17][18] The site was launched in April
        2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few
        months as a beta release.[19] Its name was chosen as a compound of Git and hub.[20]

       <h1> Structure of the organization</h1>
        GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers, instead relying on self-management.[21]
        Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but the chief executive set
        salaries.[22]

        In 2014, the company added a layer of middle management in response to harassment allegations against its
        co-founder and then-CEO, Thomas Preston-Werner, and his wife, Theresa Preston-Werner. As a result of the
        scandal, Tom Preston-Werner resigned from his position as CEO.[23] Co-founder and Product lead, Chris Wanstrath,
        became CEO. Julio Avalos, then General Counsel and Administrative Officer, assumed control over GitHub's
        business operations and day-to-day management.[24]

        <h2>Finance</h2>
        GitHub was a bootstrapped start-up business, which in its first years[1] provided enough revenue to be funded
        solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.[25]

        In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in venture
        capital[9] with a $750 million valuation.[26]

        <mark class="qw">In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a series B round.
        The lead investor was Sequoia Capital, and other investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, IVP
        (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.[27][28] The company was then valued at
        approximately $2 billion.[29]

        As of 2023, GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue annually.[2]
