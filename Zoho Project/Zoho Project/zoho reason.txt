The horizontal (left-right) scroll bar is appearing because the **total width of the content** within your `<body>` is **exceeding the width of the viewport** (the visible screen area of the browser).

This is primarily due to a few specific CSS properties you've used that position elements far to the right, causing them to spill over the edge of the screen:

## 🔍 Key Scroll-Causing Elements and CSS

The main culprits are elements that use **absolute or relative positioning** combined with a large `left` value, or elements that have a fixed large width and are positioned in a way that doesn't account for margins or the viewport edge.

  * **1. The `.flexbox` container (Relative Width and Positioning):**

      * ```css
          .flexbox {
              /* ... other styles */
              height: 1000px;
              width: 100%; /* Takes 100% of the body/viewport width */
              padding-top: 80px;
          }
        ```
      * While `width: 100%` seems fine, its children are using large `left` offsets, which push the container's *content* beyond its right edge, and thus beyond the viewport.

  * **2. The `.crm` (Customer Relationship Management) div:**

      * ```css
          .crm {
              /* ... other styles */
              position: relative;
              **left: 21%;** /* Pushes the element 21% from the left edge of its parent (.flexbox) */
              width: 30%; /* The element itself is 30% wide */
              /* ... other styles */
          }
        ```
      * Since `.flexbox` is `100%` wide, `.crm` starts at the $21\%$ mark and extends for another $30\%$. Its right edge is at $21\% + 30\% = 51\%$ of the viewport. This element itself isn't the primary problem, but its children's positioning contributes to the overall content width.

  * **3. The `.bigimg` (Large Image Background) div:**

      * ```css
          .bigimg {
              /* ... other styles */
              height: 300px;
              max-width: 100%;
              width: 100%;
              position: absolute; /* Takes it out of the normal flow */
              background-size: 80%;
              background-repeat: no-repeat;
              /* ... other styles */
              **top: 530px;**
              **right: 18%;** /* This positions the right edge 18% from the viewport's right edge. */
          }
        ```
      * This element has `width: 100%` and is positioned `right: 18%` *absolutely* relative to the viewport. A $100\%$ width element cannot start $18\%$ from the right and still fit; its $100\%$ width, plus the $18\%$ offset, will exceed the screen width by $18\%$, forcing the scroll bar.

  * **4. The `.right1` Navigation Bar elements:**

      * ```css
          .right1 {
              /* ... other styles */
              position: relative;
              **left: 80%;** /* Pushes the entire block 80% from the left */
              width: 15%; /* The block itself is 15% wide */
              /* ... other styles */
          }
        ```
      * The element starts at $80\%$ and is $15\%$ wide, meaning its right edge is at $80\% + 15\% = 95\%$. This is usually fine, but when combined with the large `left` margins on the main text sections (like `.te`, `.sp`), they can create a collective width overflow.

## ✅ How to Fix It

The best way to fix this is to use **Flexbox** or **Grid** to properly align and space your elements, especially the navigation bar and the main content section, rather than relying on absolute positioning with large `left` or `right` values.

### 1\. Fix the `mai` (Header) and `right1`

Instead of pushing `.right1` with `left: 80%`, align its parent's content using Flexbox properties:

  * **Change `mai`:** Make its children justify their space.
    ```css
    .mai {
        /* ... existing styles ... */
        display: flex; /* Make it a flex container */
        justify-content: space-between; /* Space out the logo/nav (flexe1) and the sign-in block (right1) */
        align-items: center;
        padding: 0 5%; /* Add padding to keep content off the edges */
    }

    .flexe1 {
        /* Remove or reduce any large left/right positioning on children */
        top: 0; /* Remove top offset */
        left: 0; /* Remove left offset */
    }

    .right1 {
        /* ... existing styles ... */
        position: static; /* Remove relative positioning */
        left: auto; /* Remove left offset */
        bottom: auto; /* Remove bottom offset */
        border: none; /* Remove border */
        width: auto; /* Let content dictate width */
    }
    ```

### 2\. Fix the `.bigimg`

Since it has `width: 100%` and `right: 18%`, it's guaranteed to overflow. Change its width or positioning.

**Option A (Recommended for absolute image):** Set `width` so it doesn't overlap the right offset.

```css
.bigimg {
    /* ... existing styles ... */
    position: absolute;
    width: 82%; /* 100% - 18% offset = 82% */
    right: 18%;
    /* top, background-size, etc. */
}
```

**Option B (Better for responsive design):** Use the `max-width` property and remove the explicit `width: 100%` and `right: 18%` from the container. Let the flex container manage it.

### 3\. Review all elements with large `left` properties (e.g., `.te`, `.sp`, `.fonr`, `.one`, `.fo`):

These all use a large `left` property (e.g., `left: 10%`, `left: 180px`, `left: 20%`) without adjusting their width, which pushes them to the right and often causes the scroll bar. Use **`margin-left`** instead, or apply **`padding`** to their parent container (`.flexbox`, `.yellow`) to indent the content without causing overflow.

```css
/* Change this: */
.te {
    /* ... */
    position: relative;
    left: 10%; /* Bad practice for indentation */
    /* ... */
}

/* To this: */
.te {
    /* ... */
    position: static; /* Remove positioning */
    margin-left: 10%; /* Use margin for indentation */
    /* ... */
}
```

Would you like me to focus on one of these sections, like the header or the main content layout, and provide the updated, corrected CSS code?
