    <h1>Raspberry Pi </h1>
    <h2>A Single Board Computer</h2>
    <p>Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the
        Raspberry Pi Foundation in collaboration with Broadcom. To commercialize the product and support its growing
        demand, the Foundation established a commercial entity, Raspberry Pi Holdings, a public company that trades on
        the London Stock Exchange.

        The Raspberry Pi was originally created to help teach computer science in schools, but gained popularity for
        many other uses due to its low cost, compact size, and flexibility. It is now used in areas such as industrial
        automation, robotics, home automation, IoT devices, and hobbyist projects.

        The company's products range from simple microcontrollers to computers that the company markets as being
        powerful enough to be used as a general purpose PC. Computers are built around a custom designed system on a
        chip and offer features such as HDMI video/audio output, USB ports, wireless networking, GPIO pins, and up to 16
        GB of RAM. Storage is typically provided via microSD cards.

        In 2015, the Raspberry Pi surpassed the ZX Spectrum as the best-selling British computer of all time. As of
        March 2025, 68 million units had been sold.</p>

    <div>The Raspberry Pi Foundation was established in 2008 by a group including Eben Upton,[1] in response to a
        noticeable decline in both the number and skill level of students applying to study computer science University
        of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The foundation's goal was to create a low-cost computer to help rekindle
        interest in programming among schoolchildren.[2][3][4]

        This mission was inspired by the aims of the BBC Micro computer of the early 1980s, which was developed by Acorn
        Computers as part of a BBC initiative to promote computer literacy in UK schools.[5] The names "Model A" and
        "Model B" were chosen as a deliberate homage to the BBC Micro.[6] The name "Raspberry Pi" combines the
        fruit-themed naming convention used by early computer companies with a nod to the Python programming
        language.[7]


        An early alpha-test board in operation using different layout from later beta and production boards
        The first prototypes resembled small USB sticks.[8] By August 2011, fifty functionally complete "alpha" boards
        were produced for testing,[9] with demonstrations showing them running a Debian-based desktop and handling 1080p
        video playback.[10][11] In late 2011, twenty-five "beta" boards were finalized,[12][13][14] and to generate
        publicity before the official launch, ten of these were auctioned on eBay in early 2012.[15][16]

        The first commercial Raspberry Pi, the Model B, was launched on 29 February 2012, with an initial price of
        $35.[17] Demand far exceeded expectations, causing the websites of the two initial licensed distributors,
        Premier Farnell and RS Components, to crash from high traffic.[18][19][20] Initial batches sold out almost
        immediately, with one distributor reporting over 100,000 pre-orders on the first day.[17] The lower-cost $25
        Model A followed on 4 February 2013.[21]

        The Raspberry Pi did not ship with a pre-installed operating system. While ports of RISC OS 5 and Fedora Linux
        were available,[22][23][24] a port of Debian called Raspbian quickly became the standard. Released in July 2012,
        it was optimized to leverage the Raspberry Pi's floating-point unit, offering significant performance
        gains.[25][26] Raspberry Pi quickly endorsed it as the official recommended OS, and by September 2013, the
        company assumed leadership of Raspbian's development.[27]</div>
