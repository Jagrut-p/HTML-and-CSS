    <p><mark>ón Luis Ayala Rodríguez</mark> (Spanish: [raˈmon lwis aˈʝala roˈðɾiɣes]; born February 3, 1976),[2][8][9] known
        professionally as Daddy Yankee (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈdædi ˈjæŋki]), is a Puerto Rican rapper, singer,
        songwriter, and actor who rose to worldwide prominence in 2004 with the song "Gasolina". Dubbed the "King of
        Reggaeton",[4] he is often cited as an influence by other Hispanic urban performers. He retired on December 3,
        2023, after completing his final stage performance on his "La Meta" tour in Puerto Rico.[10]

        Ayala was born in Río Piedras and was raised in the Villa Kennedy Housing Projects neighborhood.[11] He aspired
        to be a professional baseball player and tried out for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball.[11] Before
        he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a
        studio recording session with reggaeton artist DJ Playero.[11] Ayala spent roughly a year and a half recovering
        from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing
        him to focus entirely on a music career.

        In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his international hit single "Gasolina", which is credited with introducing
        reggaeton to audiences worldwide, and making the music genre a global phenomenon. Since then, he has sold
        around 30 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. Daddy Yankee's album
        Barrio Fino made history when it became the top-selling Latin music album of the decade between 2000 and
        2009./p>
