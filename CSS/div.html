                    developed by Acorn Computers as part of a BBC initiative to promote computer literacy in UK
                    schools. The names "Model A" and "Model B" were chosen as a deliberate homage to the BBC
                    Micro. The name "Raspberry Pi" combines the fruit-themed naming convention used by early computer
                    companies with a nod to the Python programming language.</b></i></font></div>

    <div style="background-color: blue;">Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed
                    in the United Kingdom by the
                    Raspberry Pi Foundation in collaboration with Broadcom. To commercialize the product and support its
                    growing
                    demand, the Foundation established a commercial entity, Raspberry Pi Holdings, a public company that
                    trades
                    on
                    the London Stock Exchange. The Raspberry Pi was originally created to help teach computer science in
                    schools, but gained popularity for
                    many other uses due to its low cost, compact size, and flexibility. It is now used in areas such as
                    industrial
                    automation, robotics, home automation, IoT devices, and hobbyist projects. <br><br> The Raspberry Pi
                    Foundation was established in 2008 by a group including Eben Upton, in response to a noticeable
                    decline in both the number and skill level of students applying to study computer science University
                    of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The foundation's goal was to create a low-cost computer to help
                    rekindle interest in programming among schoolchildren.
