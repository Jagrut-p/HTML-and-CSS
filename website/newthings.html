    <p>The MacBook Pro is a line of Mac laptop computers developed and manufactured by Apple. Introduced in 2006, it is
        the high-end sibling of the MacBook family, sitting above the ultra-portable MacBook Air and previously the
        low-end MacBook line. It is currently sold with 14-inch and 16-inch screens, all using Apple M-series chips.
        Before Apple silicon, the MacBook Pro used Intel chips, and was the first laptop made by Apple to do so,
        replacing the earlier PowerBook. It was also the first Apple laptop to carry the MacBook moniker.

        Overview
        The first MacBook Pro used a similar design to the PowerBook G4, but replaced the PowerPC G4 chips with Intel
        Core Duo processors, added an iSight webcam, and introduced the MagSafe power connector. The 15-inch model was
        introduced in January 2006 followed by the 17-inch model in April. Later revisions added Intel Core 2 Duo
        processors and LED-backlit displays.

        The unibody 15-inch model debuted in October 2008, with a 17-inch variant added in January 2009. In June of
        2009, a 13-inch variant was added to the MacBook Pro lineup, replacing the aluminum unibody MacBook. The
        "unibody" MacBook Pros are named as such because the case is machined from a single piece of aluminum. It has a
        thinner flush display than its predecessors, a redesigned trackpad whose entire surface acts as a single
        clickable button, and a redesigned keyboard. Updates brought Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, and introduced
        Intel's Thunderbolt connector.

        The Retina MacBook Pro was released in 2012: the 15-inch in June and a 13-inch model in October. It is thinner
        than its predecessor, made solid-state storage (SSD) standard, added HDMI, and included a high-resolution Retina
        display. It eliminated Ethernet, FireWire ports and the optical drive.

        The Touch Bar MacBook Pro, released in October 2016, adopted USB-C for all data ports and power and included a
        shallower "butterfly"-mechanism keyboard. On all but the base model, the function keys were replaced with an
        OLED touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar with a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button.

        A November 2019 revision to the Touch Bar MacBook Pro introduced the Magic Keyboard, which uses a scissor-switch
        mechanism.[4] The initial 16-inch model with a screen set in narrower bezels was followed by a 13-inch model in
        May 2020. This revision also modified the Touch Bar, as users were complaining about the ESC key disappearing
        and not being able to exit a computer window.[5] Therefore, it was put as a whole button as it was standard
        before Touch Bar Macs.

        Another revision to the Touch Bar MacBook Pro was released in November 2020; it was the first MacBook Pro to
        feature an Apple-designed system on a chip, the Apple M1. In 2022, the Touch Bar MacBook Pro was updated to
        feature an Apple M2 chip.

        The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros were released in October 2021. Powered by either M1 Pro or M1 Max chips,
        they are the first to be available only with an Apple silicon system on a chip. These models re-introduced
        MagSafe, function keys, HDMI, an SD card reader, and some other elements that had been removed from the Touch
        Bar MacBook Pro.

        Alongside the redesigned M2 MacBook Air, Apple refreshed the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros powered by either the
        M2 Pro or M2 Max chip in January of 2023. Later that year, in November 2023, Apple refreshed the 14- and 16-inch
        MacBook Pros with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips. Apple also released a base model 14-inch MacBook Pro powered by
        the Apple M3 chip to replace the discontinued base model 13-inch Touch Bar MacBook Pro.</p>
